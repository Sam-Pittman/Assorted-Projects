Hi there!

For the Locally Saved Journal, there are 3 files:
- The Profile.py file includes different classes for Post and Profile Objects.
- The a2.py contains the user interface code
- The ui.py file contains functions used to create, edit, save, and retrieve profiles from the computer

If you run a2.py it will be pretty straightforward. Just enter a local path where you will want to save your files.
