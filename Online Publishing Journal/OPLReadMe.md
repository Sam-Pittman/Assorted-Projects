The Online Publishing Journal is almost identical to the Locally Saved Journal but interacts with an online server we used in my coding class.

Unfortunately, you cannot access it as a non-UCI individual but feel free to take a look at the ds_client.py and ds_protocol.py files to see different functions used when interacting with the server.
